      <p>As the end of 2019 approaches, the New York Police Department has reported that hate crimes have risen 
        33 percent in New York City. The rise is attributed to a 53 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents, 
        a 92 percent increase in anti-White incidents, eight percent increase in crimes motivated by sexual orientation 
        and a seven percent increase in hate crimes against black people.</p>
<h3>2019 Hate Crimes in NYC</h3>
<div id="piechart" class="chart"></div>

<p>In the rest of New York, the rise of anti-Semitic crime has become a pattern. The FBI suggested that hot-button 
  political topics could be attributed to the increase of crimes against others. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/hate-crimes-fbi-report.html">In 2018, hate crimes in America 
  reached a 16-year high.</a></p>

  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/nyregion/jersey-city-shooting.html">A recent shooting in nearby Jersey City</a> has again 
  brought anti-Semitism back into public discussion. Recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/trump-anti-semitism-jews.html"></a> President Trump signed an executive order</a>
  in an attempt to combat anti-Israel protests on campus, a movement that critics call anti-Semitic.</p>
